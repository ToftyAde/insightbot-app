Quantum Composition: Teaching AI to 'Understand' Like Humans,"Quantum Composition: Teaching AI to 'Understand' Like Humans Tired of AI that excels at pattern recognition but struggles with novel combinations? Current models often fail when faced with scenarios they haven't explicitly seen during training. Imagine asking an AI to describe a ""blue cube on a red sphere"" and it malfunctions because it only saw blue spheres and red cubes. The core issue? Compositional generalization. It's the ability to understand and process new concepts by combining previously learned elements in unforeseen ways.
